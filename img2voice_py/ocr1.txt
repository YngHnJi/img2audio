glass and steel. In front of it is a large metal sculpture that
the Dauntless climb after school, daring each other to go
higher and higher. Last year I watched one of them fall
and break her leg. I was the one who ran to get the nurse.

“Aptitude tests today,” I say. Caleb is not quite a year
older than I am, so we are in the same year at school.

He nods as we pass through the front doors. My muscles
tighten the second we walk in. The atmosphere feels
hungry, like every sixteen-year-old is trying to devour as
much as he can get of this last day. It is likely that we will

not walk these halls again after the Choosing Ceremony—
once we choose, our new factions will be responsible for
finishing our education.

Our classes are cut in half today, so we will attend all
of them before the aptitude tests, which take place after
lunch. My heart rate is already elevated.

“You aren't at all worried about what they'll tell you?” I
ask Caleb.

We pause at the split in the hallway where he will go
one way, toward Advanced Math, and I will go the other,
toward Faction History.

He raises an eyebrow at me. “Are you?”

I could tell him I've been worried for weeks about
what the aptitude test will tell me—Abnegation, Candor,
Erudite, Amity, or Dauntless?
